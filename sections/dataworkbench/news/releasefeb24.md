# February 2024 release

Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the February 2024 release. This release is focused on Solution Partner, so the changes are related to from whom you get your data and how you can share your data with your trusted partners.

## New features
This section covers new features.

### See what data integrations you're using
Now, on your workspace's Home page, below the navigation, you see the data integrations you're using. In other words, you see from whom you are getting your data. You can select the data integration tile to learn more about it.

If you need a data integration configured in your workspace, request it from the Data Workbench team.

Below is an example.

### See data integration banners
Now, when a template page is loaded, under the navigation menu, you see a banner for the data integration you are using. You can close the banner if you want to. The banner shows some information about the data integration and may link to its Marketplace page.

### Use data integration template

## Changes in existing features
This section covers changes in existing features.

### Bulk save and share data sets
Now, you can save and share data sets in bulk. You see a list of the data sets you're sharing and saving, and you can only share them with your verified contacts (users or workspaces) to avoid accidentally sharing data with people outside of your trust network.

US 529744, US 535142

### Longer data set names
We have increased the maximum length of a data set name from 64 to 128 characters.

## Exceptions for the Poseidon and SSC templates
The following changes don't apply to Poseidon and SSC templates:
* 'See what data integrations you're using' so for these templates, so we don't display the tiles of data integrations that are in use for these templates.
* There are no verified contacts when you share data sets, and you can share the data sets with any Data Workbench user or workspace.
